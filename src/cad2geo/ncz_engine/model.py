"""Stable data contract shared by the NCZ engine and QGIS integration.

The engine decodes an NCZ drawing into these dataclasses and the exporters
consume them; nothing outside this module constructs the engine's output
shape. Two consequences follow.

The field names are public. They are what a caller writes in a column map
and what the on-disk index cache stores, so renaming a field is a
cache-invalidating change and not a private tidy-up.

The field order is public too. It is the order the coordinate and attribute
readers fill, and the order a positional consumer expects, so fields are
appended at the end rather than inserted.
